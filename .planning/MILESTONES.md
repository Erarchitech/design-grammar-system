## v2.0 DG Plugin - Design State and Validation Runs (Shipped: 2026-05-10)

**Phases completed:** 6 phases, 10 plans

- VALIDATION RUNS component with rule/state filtering and deterministic output schema
- Trigger-based REINSTATE component with 7-value per-parameter status reporting (Applied, MissingTarget, TypeMismatch, etc.)
- Model Viewer grouping strip with Rule/Design-State switch, collapsible groups, resize handle, localStorage persistence
- E2E hardening: What+Where+How-to-fix error pattern across C# (ErrorMessageTemplates), Python (structured JSON errors), JS (hint extraction)
- 18/18 requirements validated via human UAT
