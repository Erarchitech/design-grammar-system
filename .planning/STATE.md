# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-05)

**Core value:** Architects can express design constraints in plain language and validate 3D models against them — and now store, update, and query project knowledge in the same tool
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — n8n-knowledge-workflows-llm-ingest-and-query

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 03
Last activity: 2026-04-06

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Active for current work:

- Knowledge graph uses `graph:"KnowledgeGraph"` isolation — never cross-label with Metagraph/OntoGraph
- Three-step Update flow (Match → Propose → Confirm) is non-negotiable — prevents silent LLM overwrites
- Session history stored in Neo4j KnowledgeSession nodes — localStorage explicitly ruled out
- Diff computed server-side with Python difflib, rendered client-side via dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- No new Docker services — all new endpoints added to existing data-service FastAPI app

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Ollama prompt structure for extracting `{title, tags, content}` from NL insert input is not yet defined — review existing `rules-to-metagraph.json` prompt before implementation
- Phase 4: Diff marker convention (LLM-annotated `[DEL]/[INS]` vs pure `difflib` output) needs a decision before implementation begins
- Phase 7: NeoVis node colors for KnowledgeNote vs KnowledgeTag vs SWRL nodes not yet designed
